# BTCPay Server Apps
The primary purpose of BTCPay Server is to remove dependencies on trusted third-parties. The Apps are built in applications that obsolete central-authorities and allow users an easy way to extend the [use case](UseCase.md) of the software. Users can self-host all sorts of customizable applications that work out of the box.

To create an app, go to Apps > Create a new app. Apps are store-dependent, which means that each app needs to be connected to a store.

## Point of Sale App
The web-based PoS app allows users with brick and mortar stores to readily accept cryptocurrencies without fees or a third-party, directly to their wallet. The PoS can be displayed easily on tablets or any other devices which support web browsing. Users can easily create a homescreen shortcut for a quick access to the web-app.

Adding new products is easy. The app has a shopping cart feature, tips, custom payment options and more.

Point of sale app can also be used for receiving donations or even as a small e-shop, depending on the customizations applied.

## Crowdfunding App

Crowdfunding is an application which you can launch from BTCPay Server interface that allows you to create a self-hosted funding campaign, similar to Kickstarter or Indiegogo. Unlike traditional crowdfunding platforms, the creator of the campaign is the owner of the platform. Funds go directly to the creatorâ€™s wallet without any fees.
