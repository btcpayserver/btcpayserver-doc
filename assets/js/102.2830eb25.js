But if you want instant channel inbound liquidity, use the Swap In feature to bring in Bitcoin, then create a lightning invoice from an outside lightning wallet such as Breez or Phoenix wallet, and pay it via the Payments tab in Breez.  This lubricates the channels and your inbound liquidity will increase by the amount of your paid outbound invoice. You pay the channel open fee, instead of your customers. The amount you set your inbound liquidity is up to you so make it high enough that you don't have to regularly increase channel size which costs you sats down the road.
