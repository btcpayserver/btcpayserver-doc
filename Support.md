# Support

This project is open source, and is not a company. Instead we rely on a network of contributors and users to provide support.

## Free support

Problem ? Don't worry, someone else has probably been through that before you. 

* First have a look at [NBitStack](https://nbitstack.com/c/btcpayserver) for a curated list of topics already answered by the community.

* If your issue is not referenced there, or you want to request a new feature, please open a [github issue](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/issues).
 
If you have more general questions about BTCPay, the way it works and why you should use it, you're welcome on our [Slack](http://slack.btcpayserver.org/).
