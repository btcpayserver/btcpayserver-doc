# BTCPay Server Use Case

While primarily build for merchants, BTCPay server is feature-rich software which has plenty of use-cases and solves problems for different users. In this guide, we will show you some of the use-cases of BTCPay. The usage of the software is not limited to these groups.

## Merchants

Benefits of using BTCPay as a merchant:

* Saving money (no fees, no subscriptions)
* Payments go directly to your wallet (No third-party)
* Enhanced privacy for you and your customers
* Easy integration and installation
* Self-sovereignty 

### Online Store

If you're a merchant with an e-commerce business, you quickly can easily [deploy BTCPay](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/deployment) and connect it to your store via [integration plugins](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/integrations/) in just a few clicks. BTCPay checkout is no different to any other payment gateway. Your customer gets an invoice. They pay it by scanning a QR code or by copy-pasting the amount and the address. When their payment is confirmed, you will be notified via your e-commerce CMS; you can ship the item. Take a look at [our demo online store](https://store.demo.btcpayserver.org/).

### Physical Store

For brick and mortar stores, BTCPay has a [web-based Point of Sale](https://mainnet.demo.btcpayserver.org/apps/87kj5yKay8mB4UUZcJhZH5TqDKMD3CznjwLjiu1oYZXe/pos) (POS) App which can be customized. Similarly to the online store, your customer is presented with an invoice which needs to be paid. You can create a watch-only wallet on your phone to be notified of the payments through the POS, without the need of any additional software. There are plans on developing the POS mobile app which would make the process even smoother.

## Charities and Content Creators (Donations)

Charities, non-profits, content creators and other organization that want to accept cryptocurrency donations in a more private way than the traditional single-address can use the [Pay Button](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/btcpay-basics/gettingstarted#creating-the-pay-button) or the [POS app](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-doc/blob/master/GettingStarted.md#creating-the-point-of-sale-app).

Benefits of using BTCPay for accepting donations:

* Saving money (no fees, no subscriptions)
* Payments go directly to your wallet (No third-party)
* Enhanced privacy for you and donors (no address re-use, no IP leaks to third parties)

There are additional features for the future releases that would enable crowdfunding and dynamic invoices for future releases.

## Local Payment Processor

When you deploy a self-hosted BTCPay Server, you can attach and create an unlimited number of stores and apps. This means when you launch BTCPay, you can become a payment processor for your family members, friends or the local community. You're allowing them to rely on your full node, but the payments go directly to their wallets. You have zero control over their funds and cannot charge a processing fee. You can, however, develop a registration paywall and charge monthly fees. 

Benefits of being a local payment processor:

* Saving money (no fees, no subscriptions)
* Payments go directly to your customers' wallets
* Easy registration

Take a look at the list of [third-party hosts](ThirdPartyHosting.md).

## Cryptocurrency Exchanges

The number of merchants using BTCPay is growing each day. That's why the exchanges can develop integration with BTCPay and allow instant conversion of cryptocurrency payment to local fiat currency for merchants. Immediate conversion helps with mitigating the volatility risk and can be a new revenue opportunity for the exchanges. BTCPay takes away the centralization from payment processors and gives the opportunity for any exchange, regardless of the size or the country to integrate.

## Hosting Providers

Hosting providers can create easy 1-click BTCPay deployment solutions for their customers. With the growing interest in BTCPay, companies can make money by hosting easily-depoyable BTCPay instances for merchants.

## Lightning Network Users

BTCPay offers a very easy way to deploy a Lightning Network node. You can use and experiment with this innovative second-layer solution build on top of Bitcoin by [following this guide](LightningNetwork.md
). Both merchants and customers can use BTCPay to receive or make payments off-chain with instant confirmations and neglectable network fees.

## Developers

BTCPay community is amiable and open-minded. Developers can not only learn a lot and get their name out by working on an open-source project, but also participate in transforming the payment processing.

These are some of the many ways in which you can use BTCPay. Unleash your creativity and feel free to build your own solutions that solve problems.
