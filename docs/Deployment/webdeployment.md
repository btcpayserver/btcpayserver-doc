# Introduction to Web Deployments.

We will take you through possible `Web Deployments` on this page and update the list as more providers offer BTCPay Server as a service. 
But what is a `Web deployment`? 
In short, a third-party hosted environment. 

What do they do? They offer you the user, storage space, and compute power. 
And in particular, for this page, they offer hosted Bitcoin nodes. 

Now you don't have to buy, host and maintain your own hardware. The service provider takes care of this. 
This comes with the risk factor of trusting someone to host your bitcoin node and BTCPay Server on top of that. 
Every hoster comes with its own pros and cons. One might be cheaper, and the other maybe has better support levels. 
However, we will guide you through the ones we've listed and offer BTCPay Server solutions.

Below you will find a short introduction to each service and a detailed guide on each of them.
