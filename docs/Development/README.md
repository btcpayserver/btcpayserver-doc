# Architecture

BTCPayServer is a project which ties together **several Bitcoin-related components** into a coherent user experience for installing and managing your own payment processor.

![Architecture](../img/Architecture.png)

The minimal setup involves:

- [BTCPayServer](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver)
- [NBXplorer](https://github.com/dgarage/NBXplorer) (Lightweight block explorer, responsible for tracking payments)
- Bitcoin Core
- (Optional) PostgreSQL

By default, it uses SqlLite, but all production deployments use Postgres.

Additionally, if you need Lightning Network access, NBXplorer supports connections to:

- Core Lightning (CLN) (via unix sockets)
- LND (via the REST interface)

Video below shows **BTCPay Architecture** in-depth.

We provide several ways of deploying BTCPayServer, depending on whether you favor flexibility or ease-of-use.

From the easiest way to the hardest:

- [Web-Interface LunaNode deployment](/Deployment/LunaNode.md)
- [Azure deployment](/Deployment/Azure.md) (Using a one-click deploy on Microsoft Azure)
- [Docker deployment](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Docker/) (Using a `docker-compose.yml` file which bundle all the dependencies together, in almost any environment)
- [Manual deployment](/Deployment/ManualDeployment.md) (Downloading, building and running all the dependencies by yourself)

Some community members also offer [third-party hosting](/Deployment/ThirdPartyHosting.md) (Having someone else manage BTCPayServer for you).

Remember the **huge value** of having **direct control** of your wallet and web service; for this reason we recommend you use [Azure deployment](/Deployment/Azure.md) or [Web-Interface deployment](/Deployment/LunaNode.md) and **do the setup yourself** - it is pretty easy!
