# Try out BTCPay server

Before you start using BTCPay Server in production, you can try it and see if it fits your needs.

On this page you will see various ways to test out the software on mainnet and testnet.

## Our mainnet demo server

We host our server on [mainnet.demo.btcpayserver.org](https://mainnet.demo.btcpayserver.org/login).

Feel free to register to it, create a store and a wallet and play around.

This instance should only be used for testing things out. We do not guarantee uptime.

## Our Testnet demo server

If you're familiar with testnet and want to test BTCPay through it, check [testnet.demo.btcpayserver.org](https://testnet.demo.btcpayserver.org/).

For more information see [testnet documentation](/Development/TestnetDemo.md).

## Third-party hosts

[Third-party hosts](./Deployment/ThirdPartyHosting.md) provide hosted solutions, in most cases free of charge, in case you don't want to self-host a server.

While most of them can be used in-production, you can also use them to try things out. They're similar to our demo server, but provide better uptime and reliability.

For full lists of third-party hosts to pick from, [see our hosts directory](https://directory.btcpayserver.org/filter/hosts).

## Start testing

Once you pick up a server to use, the steps are the same, regardless of which option you've opted for.
