# Contribute to the Directory

The Directory has been created to showcase the possibilities of BTCPay Server for merchant checkouts, donations, fundraisers, or any other use-case users come up with.

It contains a non-exhaustive list of websites that use the software.

----
Contributing to directory follows the same process as contributing for the stack.

The file used to create the list in the Directory is located here: `.vuepress/list.js`

Only websites that use BTCPay Server are accepted in the Directory.

**Step 1**
