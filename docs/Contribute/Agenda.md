# Open Community Calls

BTCPay Server operates as an open-organization. All of our meetings where we discuss the development, design, documentation or other topics are opened for anyone to join in and participate. To get involved, you can subscribe to our open-calendar and stay in the loop on what we're working on, learn, ask questions or just join us in building open-source bitcoin payment rails.
Follow the steps below to add the BTCPay Server `Open Community Calls` calendar to your own.

## Submitting a call to the calendar.

Calls are scheduled via Github issues. 
You can find all upcoming calls with their designated tags [Here](https://github.com/btcpayserver/organization/issues)

There are two requirements for an issue to be included:

* The issue needs to include a UTCTime meta property following this format: UTCTime: 2020-10-14 9:00 UTC -7
* A maintainer needs to add the `Call` label to the issue (this prevents spam)
* The calendar auto-updates whenever a new issue is created or an existing issue is edited
