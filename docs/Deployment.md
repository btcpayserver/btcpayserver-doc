# Choosing a Deployment Method

There are several **different deployment methods** available, all using **the same BTCPay Server software**. Because BTCPay is a free and open-source cryptocurrency payment processor, we support diversity in deployment methods for users. Different solutions work best for [different use cases](./UseCase.md).

Business deployment methods can vary by setup, maintenance, support, price, etc. You can run **BTCPay as a self-hosted** solution on your own server, or use a **third-party host**. The self-hosted solution allows you not only to attach an unlimited number of stores and use the [Lightning Network](./LightningNetwork.md) but also become a payment processor for others.

BTCPay is a non-custodial invoicing system which eliminates the involvement of a third-party when managing funds. Payments with BTCPay go directly to your wallet. Your private keys are never uploaded to the server. Meaning **3rd Party BTCPay hosts do not control user funds**, they are simply hosting your instance of the BTCPay software for you.

:::danger
Manual deployments and Hardware builds are not recommended for production environments and require the user to have technical knowledge related to the build.
