# Connecting Ledger Wallet to BTCPay Server

This document shows **how to connect Ledger Nano S Wallet to BTCPay Server**.

:::warning
Direct Ledger Nano S integration is **no longer supported**. For Bitcoin wallets, you can use your Ledger hardware wallet regularly via the [new hardware wallet integration](./HardwareWalletIntegration.md.md).

For [altcoin](./Altcoins.md) wallets, you can spend funds from your external wallet, sign a transaction within the [internal wallet](./Wallet.md) with [HD Private Key or mnemonic seed](./Wallet.md#signing-with-hd-private-key-or-mnemonic-seed) or a [hot wallet](./Wallet.md#signing-with-a-hot-wallet).

To set up a new altcoin wallet, add the xpub key manually or [create a new wallet](./CreateWallet.md).
