# Hardware Wallet Integration

For optimal balance between ease of use, security and privacy, it's recommended to use [BTCPay Server Wallet](Wallet.md) with a hardware wallet.

The hardware wallet integration within BTCPay Server allows you to import your hardware wallet and spend the incoming funds with a simple confirmation on your device. Your private keys never leave the device and all funds are being validated against your own full node and no data leakage.
