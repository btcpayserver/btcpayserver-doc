## Connecting the store

The Prestashop BTCPay Server module is a **bridge between your server (the payment processor) and your e-commerce store**.
No matter if you're using a self-hosted or third-party solution from step 2, the setup process is identical.

1. In the `BTCPay Server URL`-field, enter the full URL of your host (including the https) â€“ for example https://testnet.demo.btcpayserver.org
2. Select the default transaction speed (this will change how much BTCPay recommends as transaction fee).
3. Select the relevant order mode for your store (order is created before or after payment).
4. Select if you want to send customer metadata to your BTCPay server instance for bookkeeping.
5. Press `Connect` to save your settings and be redirected to your BTCPay Server instance to create an API key.
6. When creating the API key, make sure to give the permissions to a specific store (multiple stores are not supported).

7. Press the `Authorize app`-button after which you will be redirected back to your Prestashop store.
8. Prestashop will try and create a connection to your BTCPay Server instance.
9. A message will be shown if the connection was successful (but it is smart to make a test purchase).
