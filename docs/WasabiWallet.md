**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Write down your recovery words in the order you see them on the screen. Write them down a piece of paper and store them somewhere secure. Take your time and triple-check each word. Do not store your seed in a digital format (photograph, text document). Whoever has access to your seed and your password can access your funds. Make sure you have a proper backup of the Recovery Words and the Password.

Select a Coinjoin Strategy.
Wasabi automatically coinjoins all your funds. 
If you don't want to coinjoin your funds, you can disable coinjoin later by disabling `Automatically start coinjoin` in the Coinjoin Settings.	 
For more info about coinjoins and the related settings, please refer to the [Wasabi Documentation](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/).

### Connecting Wasabi to BTCPay Server Full Node (If you're self-hosting BTCPay)

After the wallets are connected, it is highly recommended to **connect Wasabi Wallet to your full node in BTCPay**. The process is easy but can only be done if you self-host BTCPay and are logged in as `Admin`. Tor has to be enabled in BTCPay (it is enabled by default). This process enhances privacy even further.

In BTCPay, go Server Settings > Services > **Full node P2P > See Information**.
On the BTCP-P2P page, click on the `Show Confidential QR Code`. Bellow the QR Code, there's a link `See QR Code information by clicking here`, so click on the link to reveal your string. Copy the string but remove `bitcoin-p2p://` part.

In Wasabi, go to the Bitcoin tab at `Settings` and paste the endpoint in `Bitcoin P2P Endpoint`.

Restart Wasabi to apply the changes.

### Configuring the Gap Limit in Wasabi

At the search bar on top, click on `Wallet Folder`. Shortly the `json` file will be shown in a sub-folder. Open that file with a text editor like notepad.
Find the line `"MinGapLimit": 21,` and change it to `"MinGapLimit": 100,` and save the file.

There's no good answer to how much you should set the gap limit to. Most merchants set 100-200. If you're a big merchant with high transaction volume, you can try with even a higher gap limit.

For more details about the [Gap Limit, check the FAQ](./FAQ/Wallet.md#missing-payments-in-my-software-or-hardware-wallet).

**Wasabi Wallet and BTCPay Server are now connected**. Any payments received to your BTCPay will be visible in Wasabi, where you can further spend or mix them.
