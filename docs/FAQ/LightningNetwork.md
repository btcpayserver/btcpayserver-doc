## Lightning Network General FAQ

Here are some general questions about LN in BTCPay, regardless of the implementation.

### How many users can use Lightning Network in BTCPay?

On a self-hosted server, you can use only one internal Lightning node. Server owners can use the same Lightning node for an unlimited number of stores tied to their admin account.

Since version 1.0.3.128, a BTCPay Server host can enable it's registrants to use the internal Lightning Network node.
It can be enabled in Server Settings > Policies > Allow non-admins to use the internal lightning node in their stores.

![Enable LN for Others](../img/ThirdPartyEnableLNOthers.png)

:::warning As a third-party host
All your registrants' funds will go to your own Lightning Wallet.
You will have to manually check and redispatch the funds to their respective owners. This could potentially become a burden.
:::

:::danger As an individual using a third-party host
All payments made through the Lightning Network will go to your third-party's wallet.
Take precautions and only use this option while using a trustworthy third-party host to ensure you get your funds back.
:::

Non-admin users can also connect to their own external nodes. Lightning node external connections are a technically advanced task. We recommend that if you want Lightning, you should deploy your own server instead, which comes with all the necessities bundled up.

### How to find node info and open a direct channel with a store using BTCPay?

If you're a customer trying to pay a Lightning Network invoice:

1. make sure to select "Lightning" from coin selection.
2. Select Copy/Scan
3. Select Node Info and scan or copy it manually.

![BTCPay Checkout](../img/btcpay-node-info.jpg)

The exact procedure of opening a direct Lightning Network channel depends on the wallet you’re using. But, you should be able to figure it out easily now that you have merchant’s node information.

### As a merchant, do I need to open direct channels?

Merchants need incoming channels. Other people opening a channel with them provides liquidity to the merchant. Your customer should be able to open a direct channel with you.

You can also ask well-connected nodes to open a direct channel with you. Opening a channel is not spending funds, it’s more like putting the funds on a pre-paid card, and spending it later, or withdrawing it by closing a channel.

### How can I get inbound capacity to my node?

There are many ways in which one can get an inbound capacity. We recommend that you read this great article that provides [practical tips to inbound capacity](https://medium.com/lightningto-me/practical-solutions-to-inbound-capacity-problem-in-lightning-network-60224aa13393).
When asking for inbound capacity, consider any routing policy fees the service may have. [This document](https://wiki.ion.radar.tech/tutorials/bootstrapping-liquidity) provides an overview of what kind of fees to expect from well-known nodes offering the service.

### I previously installed BTCPayServer without lightning, can I enable it?

If you did not deploy your server with a lightning implementation provided, you will need to add it to your server manually. You can do this by sshing into your server, adding the lightning option and re-running the setup script. This is also the process for changing from one lightning provider to another. The instructions can be found [here](#how-to-change-from-c-lightning-to-lnd-or-vice-versa).

Once your server has restarted, you can then click on `Test Connection` in your you store settings to verify that you have successfully configured your lightning node.

Depending on how you deployed BTCPayServer you might have different step to do:

#### Case 1: You manually installed

If you installed BTCPayServer manually without docker or Azure, then you only need to start run [CLightning](https://hub.docker.com/r/nicolasdorier/clightning/) with the correct network parameter.

Assuming you are running as root, CLightning will allow call to its API via a unix socket on `/root/.lightning/lightning-rpc`

Once this is done, make sure you start BTCPayServer with

```bash
-btclightning=/root/.lightning/lightning-rpc
```

If you are using CLightning for Litecoin, use the parameter `-ltclightning` instead.

Then, make sure the port lightning network ports `9735` (BTC) and `9736` (LTC) are open on your firewalls.

#### Case 2: You manually installed and you are using docker (without Azure)

In this case, you only have to change the docker-compose you are using.
If before you were using `docker-compose -f "$(pwd)/Production/docker-compose.btc-ltc.yml" up -d` (as documented [here](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-docker#for-docker-noobs)), then you need to change to `docker-compose -f "$(pwd)/Production/docker-compose.btc-ltc-clightning.yml" up -d`.

Then, make sure the port lightning network ports `9735` (BTC) and `9736` (LTC) are open on your firewalls.

#### Case 3: You are using Azure

Log as root:

```bash
sudo su -
```

Run

```bash
cd $DOWNLOAD_ROOT
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-azure/master/btcpay-update.sh > btcpay-update.sh
btcpay-update.sh
```

Modify the file `/etc/profile.d/btcpay-env.sh`:

You should have something like:

```bash
export BTCPAY_DOCKER_COMPOSE="/var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0/btcpayserver-docker/Production/docker-compose.btc-ltc.yml"
```

Modify by adding `-clightning` at the end:

```bash
export BTCPAY_DOCKER_COMPOSE="/var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download/0/btcpayserver-docker/Production/docker-compose.btc-ltc-clightning.yml"
```

Update your environment variables in current session by running:

```bash
. /etc/profile.d/btcpay-env.sh
```

Then restart your server:

```bash
btcpay-restart.sh
```

Then, connect to your [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/),
Go to the resource group of your install, and add a new security rule in the Network Security Group inside it. (See [this example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-create-nsg-arm-pportal#create-rules-in-an-existing-nsg))

If your resource group do not have a Network Security Group, you can skip this step. The Network Security Group has been introduced in new Azure installs.

Add a Security Inbound Rules:

Rule 1:

* Name: LightningBTC
* Priority: 150
* Source: Internet
* Destination: Any
* Port: 9735
* Protocol: TCP

Rule 2:

* Name: LightningLTC
* Priority: 151
* Source: Internet
* Destination: Any
* Port: 9736
* Protocol: TCP

Here is how it should look like:

![SecurityRules](../img/azuresecurityrule.png)

### Can I use a pruned node with LN in BTCPay?

It is recommended to use c-lightning because the implementation supports pruned nodes.

### Can I use my existing LN node with BTCPay?

If you already have a well connected lightning node with sufficient inbound liquidity, you may want to use it with BTCPay instead of the included lightning node.

To do so, go to the lightning node settings page of your store (Store > Settings > Lightning > Modify). Here on the lightning node setting page, select the option for Use a custom lightning node.

The connection strings vary per lightning implementation, the [settings page](../LightningNetwork.md#connecting-an-external-lightning-node-in-btcpay) contains the documentation for the connection settings to give you further guidance.

### How to change from c-lightning to LND or vice-versa?

:::warning
Be sure to have closed all channels and removed both on-chain and Lightning funds from the Lightning node before switching from one to the other.

:::

You need to SSH log in into your virtual machine.

To switch to LND:

```bash
sudo su -
cd btcpayserver-docker
export BTCPAYGEN_LIGHTNING="lnd"
. ./btcpay-setup.sh -i
```

To switch to c-lightning:

```bash
sudo su -
cd btcpayserver-docker
export BTCPAYGEN_LIGHTNING="clightning"
. ./btcpay-setup.sh -i
```

### I switched Lightning Network implementation, but getting "no payment available" error

When you switch from one implementation to another, you need to reconfigure your lightning connection string at a store level, to use adequate implementation. Stores > Settings > Lightning > Setup > **Connection string**. In connection string, click on the "click here" link.

### I get "WARNING: The LIGHTNING_ALIAS variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string" when starting container

You can ignore this.
If you want to set an alias for your lightning node, open the env file:

```bash
sudo su -
vim $BTCPAY_ENV_FILE
```

And add or modify the `LIGHTNING_ALIAS` entry to `LIGHTNING_ALIAS=myawesomenode`.

### How to display my Lightning Node information so that others can connect to me?

The information other users need to connect to your node, is already displayed at the checkout. Sometimes, merchants want to display their node so that their customers can connect beforehand.

There are numerous ways to find your node information, but the easiest way to display it to others is by using Lightning Node info page. Go to Store > Settings > Lightning > Modify. At the bottom of the page, there is a "Open Public Node Page" button. Click on it to see the information. The page can be embedded into your website with `<iframe>`.

![BTCPay Checkout](../img/LightningNodepPageInfo.png)

### Where can I find recovery seed backup for my Lightning Network wallet in BTCPay Server?

Originally BTCPay did use `noseedbackup`, so you couldn’t backup your LN wallet or get your recovery seed. This was because in Lightning Network there was no solution for backing up funds in channels, just in your on-chain wallet.
By now LND has functionality like static channel backup that depends on seed presence.
But once again, please understand that the Lightning Network is still in an experimental phase and do not put funds into it, which you're not [willing to lose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fMv8MpzLgQ).

#### Using LND with seed (since [`v1.0.3.138`](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/releases/tag/v1.0.3.138))

You can find the LND Seed Service under:

- Server Settings > Services > LND Seed Backup

![LND Seed Backup service](../img/LND-Service-Seed-Backup.jpg)

Safely backup and store your recovery seed. The seed is a backup of your on-chain Lightning wallet, but is also necessary to perform static channel backups.

![LND Seed Backup example](../img/LND-With-Seed-Example.jpg)

If you backed it up safely you can remove it from the server.

If you migrate from an older version to `v1.0.3.138` [this blog post on how to do the migration](https://blog.btcpayserver.org/btcpay-lnd-migration) might be helpful.

### How to disable on-chain payments and use LN payments only?

There are two easy ways to do this:

1. Store > Settings > Checkout experience > Choose default payment method at checkout
2. Store > Settings > Modify > Uncheck the Enabled box to disable on-chain payments

### How to see my Lightning Network version?

You can check your Lightning Network version from the command line.
For LND

```bash
sudo su -
cd btcpayserver-docker
./bitcoin-lncli.sh help
```

For c-lightning

```bash
sudo su -
./bitcoin-lightning-cli.sh getinfo
```

Most of the wallets (RTL, Zap, Spark, etc) that are able to your lightning node remotely will display the version on the front-end as well.

## Lightning Network (LND) FAQ

Here are some of the common questions about the [LND implementation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues) of the Lightning Network.

### How to restart my LND?

```bash
sudo su -
docker restart btcpayserver_lnd_bitcoin
```

### How to see LND logs?

To check the logs of your LND node in BTCPay Server (Docker installations) use the following command:

`docker logs --tail 40 btcpayserver_lnd_bitcoin`

You can change 40 to whatever number you wish. The number represents the lines of code that will be shown. For more information about the logs, see [Troubleshooting page](../Troubleshooting.md)

### What’s the default directory of LND in BTCPay?

`/var/lib/docker/volumes/generated_lnd_bitcoin_datadir/_data`

### Which macaroon needs to be provided for external nodes?

BTCPay Server needs the `admin.macaroon` to check whether the lightning node is fully synced before creating an invoice.
If you want to tailor a macaroon specific to the BTCPay Server connection, use the LND macaroon bakery:

```bash
lncli bakemacaroon address:read address:write info:read invoices:read invoices:write onchain:read
```

### LND connection issues after an update

Authentication tends to fail on LND after an update, symptoms are:

* In store settings, when testing the connection to your node you get `Error while connecting to the API (The HTTP status code of the response was not expected (500).)`
* In Zap wallet, `Unable to connect to host: cannot retrieve macaroon: cannot get macaroon: root key with id 0 doesn’t exist`

In such case, you need to delete the macaroon of lnd and restart it.

If you are using docker deployment, please connect with SSH to your VM and the following command:

```bash
sudo su -
docker exec btcpayserver_lnd_bitcoin rm /data/admin.macaroon
docker exec btcpayserver_lnd_bitcoin rm /data/invoice.macaroon
docker exec btcpayserver_lnd_bitcoin rm /data/readonly.macaroon
docker exec btcpayserver_lnd_bitcoin rm /data/data/macaroons.db
docker exec btcpayserver_lnd_bitcoin rm /data/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/invoice.macaroon
docker exec btcpayserver_lnd_bitcoin rm /data/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/macaroons.db
docker exec btcpayserver_lnd_bitcoin rm /data/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/readonly.macaroon
docker restart btcpayserver_lnd_bitcoin
```

If a macaroon does not exist, you will see an error message, you can safely ignore it.

Because this will invalidate the previous macaroons, you need to manually reconnect with Zap with `Server Settings / Services / LND-gRPC`.

### How to change my LND Node alias?

To change the display name of your LND node, you should ssh log in into your virtual machine and apply the following:

```bash
sudo su -
cd btcpayserver-docker
export LIGHTNING_ALIAS="namehere"
. ./btcpay-setup.sh -i
```

### How to edit lnd.conf?

To customize LND settings which are not available as environment variables, you can [create a custom fragment](../Docker/README.md#how-can-i-customize-the-generated-docker-compose-file) in `docker-compose-generator/docker-fragments/opt-lnd-config.custom.yml` like this:

```yml
version: "3"
services:
  lnd_bitcoin:
    environment:
      LND_EXTRA_ARGS: |
        minchansize=1234567
```

You can add your customizations in the `LND_EXTRA_ARGS` value, like shown by setting the `minchansize` value.

Afterwards the configuration has to be added to the additional fragments and setup needs to be run:

```bash
export BTCPAYGEN_ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENTS="$BTCPAYGEN_ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENTS;opt-lnd-config.custom"
. ./btcpay-setup.sh -i
```

This way your custom settings gets added to the config and they will persist updates.

### How to install ThunderHub?

To install ThunderHub on your instance apply the following:

```bash
export BTCPAYGEN_ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENTS="$BTCPAYGEN_ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENTS;opt-add-thunderhub"
. btcpay-setup.sh -i
```

If you get the following warning message **Unable to connect to this node** it is probably because the certificate used to communicate with LND doesn't have the correct domains. LND doesn't generate new ones unless the previous ones are deleted first.

To delete the old certificate and key and have LND generate new ones, apply the following:

```bash
docker exec btcpayserver_lnd_bitcoin rm /data/tls.cert
docker exec btcpayserver_lnd_bitcoin rm /data/tls.key
docker restart btcpayserver_lnd_bitcoin
docker restart generated_bitcoin_thub_1
```

## Lightning Network (c-lightning) FAQ

Here are some of the common questions about the [c-lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/issues) implementation of the Lightning Network.

### How to restart my c-lightning?

```bash
sudo su -
docker restart btcpayserver_clightning_bitcoin
```

### How to announce an IPv6 address?

First, copy `bitcoin-clightning.yml` into the the docker fragment folder as `bitcoin-clightning.custom.yml`.
Important: the file must end with `.custom.yml`, or there will be git conflicts whenever you run `btcpay-update.sh`.

Modify the new `bitcoin-clightning.custom.yml` as the following:

```yaml
services:
  clightning_bitcoin:
    environment:
      LIGHTNINGD_OPT: |
        announce-addr=[ipv6 here]
```

Make sure to insert the address between the two square brackets [].

Then set it up:

```bash
export BTCPAYGEN_ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENTS="bitcoin-clightning.custom"
. ./btcpay-setup.sh -i
```

### How to find an on-chain address in Spark?

To fund your on-chain wallet in Spark, you need to get an on-chain address. To find your address, click on the version link at the left corner bottom of the Spark wallet (for example v0.2.2).

That should toggle the settings. Click > Console. To generate a new address in RPC Console field, enter `newaddr` for bech32 address or `newaddr p2sh-segwit` click execute. At the bottom you should see the newly generated address.
You can also toggle help if you need help with other commands in Spark.

![BTCPay Checkout](../img/Spark-console1.png)
![BTCPay Checkout](../img/Spark-console2.png)

## How to withdraw funds from my on-chain Spark wallet?

First if your funds are in channel, you need to close channel and wait for them to get back to your on-chain wallet in Spark. (144 blocks in most cases).

Next, you need to toggle the console mode. Click on the version link at the left corner bottom of the Spark wallet [explained above](./LightningNetwork.md#lightning-network-c-lightning-faq)

That should toggle the settings. Click > Console.

In console mode there are help commands. The command needed for withdrawing from an on-chain wallet is called `withdraw`.

```
withdraw destination satoshi [feerate] [minconf]
Send to {destination} address {satoshi} (or 'all') amount via Bitcoin transaction
```

If you want to withdraw 1000 sats to bc1qjl8uwezzlech793lpnyuzy0h2cdkvxvh54v3dn, the exact command would be:

`withdraw bc1qjl8uwezzlech793lpnyuzy0h2cdkvxvh54v3dn 1000` click *execute*.

![Spark Withdraw](../img/SparkWalletWithdrawConsole.png)

Note that the address format needs to be SegWit, bech32 (starting with bc1).
