# BTCPay Magento Integration

If you're using Magento, an an open-source e-commerce platform written in PHP, you can integrate BTCPay Server and use it as a payment processor.

## Magento 1
1. Download [BTCPay Magento Plugin](https://github.com/btcpayserver/magento-plugin)
2. Follow the [quick-start guide here](https://github.com/btcpayserver/magento-plugin/blob/master/GUIDE.md)

## Magento 2
We recommend using the Magento 2 module developed by [Storefront.be](https://www.storefront.be), since it is the most feature-complete and robust. Storefront is also committed to maintaining the module as newer Magento versions are released. 

The Magento 2 module is available for free at https://github.com/storefront-bvba/magento2-btcpay-module
