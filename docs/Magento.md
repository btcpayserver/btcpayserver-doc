# BTCPay Magento Integration

If you're using **Magento**, an open-source e-commerce platform written in PHP, you can **integrate BTCPay Server and use it as a payment processor**.

## Magento 1

1. Download [BTCPay Magento Plugin](https://github.com/btcpayserver/magento-plugin)
2. Follow the [quick-start guide here](https://github.com/btcpayserver/magento-plugin/blob/master/GUIDE.md)

## Magento 2

We recommend using the **Magento 2 module** developed by [Storefront.be](https://www.storefront.be), since it is the most feature-complete and robust. Storefront is also committed to maintaining the module as newer Magento versions are released.

The Magento 2 module is available for free at https://github.com/storefront-bvba/magento2-btcpay-module
