# Hardware As A Service

Multiple entities or companies in the Bitcoin space provide **preinstalled hardware that include BTCPay Server**.
Installed for example on Raspberry Pi or Rock64 devices, the BTCPay Server instance sits besides other software stacks.

This **Hardware As A Service** can be free or paid, and is mostly open-sourced for peer-review.

They are suitable for technical users to speed up the installation and intitial syncing process.
Less-technical users will find the 1-click or plug-and-play systems of these services incredibly practical.

Here you can find a non-exhaustive list of companies that provide such a service:
