# Hardware As A Service

Multiple entities or companies in the Bitcoin space provide preinstalled hardware that include BTCPay Server.
Installed for example on Raspberry Pi or Rock64 devices, the BTCPay Server instance sits besides other software stacks.

This Hardware As A Service can be free or paid, and is mostly open-sourced for peer-review.

They are suitable for technical users to speed up the installation and intitial syncing process.
Less-technical users will find the 1-click or plug-and-play systems of these services incredibly practical.

Here you can find a non-exhaustive list of companies that provide such a service:
