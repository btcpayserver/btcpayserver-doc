# BTCPay Server Apps

The primary purpose of BTCPay Server is to remove dependencies on trusted third-parties. The Apps are built in applications that obsolete central-authorities and allow users an easy way to extend the [use case](./UseCase.md) of the software. Users can self-host all sorts of customizable applications that work out of the box.

To create an app, go to Apps > Create a new app. Apps are store-dependent, which means that each app needs to be connected to a store.

## Point of Sale App

The **web-based PoS app** allows users with brick and mortar stores to readily **accept cryptocurrencies without fees or a third-party**, directly to their wallet. The **PoS** can be displayed easily on tablets or any other devices which support web browsing. Users can easily create a homescreen shortcut for a quick access to the web-app.

Adding new products is easy. The app has a **shopping cart feature**, **tips**, **product inventory**, **custom payment options** and more.

**Point of sale app** can also be used for receiving donations or even as a small e-shop, depending on the customizations applied.

Curently, the **Point of Sale app** supports three different views: 
* A `Static` view representing only the items for sale.
* A `Cart` view including items for sale and a cart for checkout.
* A `Light` view consisting only of a keypad for easy and quick payments (Starting from [v1.0.5.6](https://blog.btcpayserver.org/btcpay-server-1-0-5-6/#simplePOS)).

To get your first **Point of Sale app** running, follow theses few simple steps:

1. Go to `Apps` and `Create a new app`
2. Add a `name` for your app
3. Choose `app type` > Point Of Sale

5. Customize your PoS by choosing a `view` (Static, Cart, Light), adding your own `items` with prices, photos, and a description.
6. Click `Save Settings`.

You can change the appearance of your **Point of Sale app** by following the [theme customization guide](./Theme.md).

You can also set limits on contribution perks using the inventory feature.

## Lightning Network Apps (Lapps)

[Lapps](https://blockstream.com/2018/03/29/blockstreams-week-of-lapps-ends/) are applications built on top of [Lightning Charge](https://blockstream.com/2018/01/16/lightning-charge/), a complimentary package that enables easier development on top of **c-lightning**. If you decided to use c-lightning, you could easily connect your BTCPay to any of the **Lapps**.

BTCPay exposes all the necessary information required to connect your internal **BTCPay c-lightning node** to a **Lightning Network App**. Go to Server Settings > Services > Lightning charge server > See information > Credentials.

Below are videos that showcase how to connect some of the lapps to BTCPay.
