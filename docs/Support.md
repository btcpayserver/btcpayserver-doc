# Support

This project is open source, and is not a company. Instead **we rely on a network of contributors and users to provide support**.

## Free support

Problem? Don't worry, someone else has probably been through that before you.

* First have a look at our [user documentation](./README.md) and [Frequently Asked Questions](./FAQ/readme.md).

* If your issue is not referenced there, or you want to request a new feature, please open a [github issue](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/issues).

* If you have more general questions about BTCPay, the way it works and why you should use it, you're welcome on our [Mattermost Chat](https://chat.btcpayserver.org/) or [Telegram](https://t.me/btcpayserver)

Getting a proper support also depends on how you formulate your questions. Read our [troubleshooting guidelines](./Troubleshooting.md).
