# WooCommerce integration

This document explains how to **integrate BTCPay Server into your WooCommerce store**.
If you do not have a store yet, follow [this step by step article](https://bitcoinshirt.co/how-to-create-store-accept-bitcoin/) to create one from scratch.

## 3. Testing the checkout

Making a small test-purchase from your store will give you peace of mind.
Always make sure that everything is set up correctly before going live.
The final video guides you through the steps of setting a gap limit in your Electrum wallet and testing the checkout process.

## 4. Customizing BTCPay WooCommerce V2

### 4.1 Global Settings

Can be found at *WooCommerce -> Settings -> Tab [BTCPay Settings]*

**BTCPay Server URL**  

URL to your BTCPay Server instance, including protocol e.g. `https://btcpay.yourdomain.com`.

**BTCPay API Key**   

Your API Key. (Was auto-generated in the steps before).

**Store ID**   

The store ID of your BTCPay Server store. Can be found on the store settings page.

**Default Customer Message**   

Here you can customize the customer message shown after selecting BTCPay payment gateway on checkout. This can be overwritten on the payment gateway settings for each gateway if you use the "Separate payment gateways" option.

**Invoice pass to "Settled" state after**   

Set after how many confirmations a payment is considered fully paid and settled. Defaults to what is configured on BTCPay store settings.

**BTCPay Order Statuses**   

Depending on your business model and store settings, you may want to configure your order statuses.
You can set BTCPay to trigger certain order status in WooCommerce automatically.

- *New* - order placed, not paid yet.
- *Paid* - order paid, not enough confirmations on the blockchain, yet.
- *Settled* - order paid, confirmed on the blockchain.
- *Settled (paid over)* - order paid, confirmed on the blockchain but paid over.
- *Invalid* - order paid, did not get a sufficient number of confirmations in a pre-defined time-frame set in BTCPay store settings, or manually marked invalid.
- *Expired* - invoice expired, order not paid.
- *Expired with partial payment* - invoice expired and paid partially

Take time to think about how you wish to automate these statuses.
If you do not wish certain BTCPay status to trigger WooCommerce order status, you can leave it as default "- no mapping / defaults -".

Note: you should keep the "Settled" order status to "- no mapping / defaults-" if you sell digital and physical products. For digital products WooCommerce will automatically skip the "Processing" status and go directly to "Completed" for those orders only containing digital products.

Another example, if a merchant wants to send an email notifying the customer that the payment has been received, but the order will be processed upon confirmation, the merchant would have to set order status for "Paid" to "On hold". Then, the merchant would have to customize and trigger email for "On hold" status of the order in WooCommerce.

It takes some time to find a perfect formula, so users should test things out before going live.

**Separate Payment Gateways**   

If this option is enabled the plugin will generate one separate payment gateway per supported payment method on BTCPay Server. E.g. if you have BTC, LightningNetwork and maybe Liquid Assets enabled on your BTCPay Server store, then you will have a separate gateway available for each. This allows many new use cases like discount per gateway or country based restrictions. More details [here](./FAQ/Integrations/#how-to-configure-additional-token-support). 

**Send customer data to BTCPayServer**   

By default *no* customer data beside email is sent to BTCPay Server. If you want to send customer address data to BTCPay Server you can enable it here.

**Debug Log**   

This option is helpful in case you have a problem and need more information on what is going on. The logs can be then found under WooCommerce -> Status -> Log. Make sure you disable this again after debugging as it will fill up your filesystem with logs.


### 4.2 Payment Gateway specific

Depending on wheter you have above mentioned "Separate Payment Gateways" enabled you will have one or more Payment Gateways available to configure in the payment gateway settings via *WooCommerce -> Settings -> Tab [Payments]*

On all payment gateways you can set the following options:

**Title**   
The shown payment gateway text on the checkout page. Defaults to "BTCPay (Bitcoin, Lightning Network, ...)".

**Customer Message**   

Here you can customize message shown after selecting BTCPay payment gateway.

**Gateway Icon**

Upload or select a custom icon to be shown next to the payment gateway during checkout. Defaults to BTCPay logo.

#### 4.2.1 BTCPay (default)

Additional options only available for the default payment gateway:

**Enforce payment tokens**

With "Separate Payment Gateways" feature enabled in BTCPay Settings you can use this option to enforce only payment tokens. This means that the created invoice will *only* include tokens of type "payment" and *not any*  of type "promotion". See difference of token types [here](./FAQ/Integrations/#how-to-configure-additional-token-support#token-types)

#### 4.2.2 Separate Payment Gateways

Additional options only available for the separate payment gateways (if that feature is enabled):

**Token Type**

By default type "payment" is selected. But if you have Liquid Assets with your own issued asset/token (e.g. used as voucher) you can select "promotion" here. Those are processed differently than normal payment tokens. Details can be found [here](./FAQ/Integrations/#how-to-configure-additional-token-support#promotional-tokens-100-discount)

# Troubleshooting

## The order states do not update although the invoice has been paid
Please check first if the webhook is created under the BTCPay Server store settings. If there is no webhook created you can visit on your WooCommerce store BTCPay Settings tab under WooCommerce settings and hit the save button. This will create the webhook.

You may also check the details of your invoice if there were any errors on sending the webhook request. Some hosting providers, firewall setups or WordPress security plugins block POST requests to your WordPress site which lead to a http status of "403 forbidden". 

You can check and verify yourself if there is something blocking requests to your site in one of these two ways:

**Check using a command line (Linux or MacOS):**   
(replace EXAMPLE.COM with your WordPress site URL)

```
curl -vX POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"data": "test"}' https://EXAMPLE.COM/?wc-api=btcpaygf_default
```

On the response, if you see that line "HTTP/1.1 500" or "HTTP/2 500" and the message "Webhook request validation failed" that means that your site is not blocking the request with a "403 forbidden".

```
.... snip ....
* We are completely uploaded and fine
< HTTP/2 500 
< server: nginx
< date: Sun, 05 Jun 2022 16:55:08 GMT
< content-type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
< x-powered-by: PHP/8.1.6
< expires: Wed, 11 Jan 1984 05:00:00 GMT
< cache-control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0
< 
* Connection #0 to host example.com left intact
{"code":"wp_die","message":"Webhook request validation failed.","data":{"status":500},"additional_errors":[]}
```

On the other side, if you see that line "HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden" or "HTTP/2 403" then something is blocking data sent to your WordPress site. You should ask your hosting provider or make sure no firewall or plugin is blocking the requests.

```
.... snip ....
* upload completely sent off: 16 out of 16 bytes
< HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
< access-control-allow-origin: *
< Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
< X-Cloud-Trace-Context: 4f07d5b2e5c2f05949d04421a8e2dd6a
< Date: Thu, 17 Feb 2022 10:06:50 GMT
< Server: Google Frontend
< Content-Length: 26
```

**Check using an online service (if you do not have a command line available:**   

- Go to [https://reqbin.com/post-online](https://reqbin.com/post-online) 
- Enter your domain: `https://EXAMPLE.COM/?wc-api=btcpaygf_default`
  (replace EXAMPLE.COM with your WordPress site URL)
- Make sure "POST" is selected
- Click [Send]

![BTCPay WordPress V2: Debug 403 error with reqbin.com](./img/woocommerce/btcpay-wc-2--reqbin-403-test.png)


If you see "Status 403 (Forbidden)" then POST requests to your site are blocked for some reason. You should ask your hosting provider or make sure no firewall or plugin is blocking the requests.

## I get an error during checkout but not sure what the problem is.

In your BTCPay Settings in your admin dashboard: *WooCommerce -> Settings: Tab [BTCPay Settings]* you can enable debug mode by setting the checkbox on that option.

You can now find more detailed Logs when you click the [View Logs] button or you go to *WooCommerce -> Status: Tab [Logs]* and select the most recent btcpay logs. 

:::warning Warning
Please make sure that you disable the debugging mode again after you finished investigating, otherwise your site performance may be impacted and also write lots of logging data in your filesystem for no reason.
::: 

Additionally you can also look into your webservers error logs if you find any error that is related to BTCPay plugin.

## Deploying WooCommerce from BTCPay Server

If you already have BTCPay Server, you can very easily start WooCommerce from your existing environment.

1. Point the external IP of the virtual machine where your BTCPay is hosted to your store domain, for example store.yourdomain.com.

2. Log into your BTCPay server as root.

```bash
sudo su -
```

3. Set up WooCommerce variables. You can add [optional variables](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-docker/blob/master/docker-compose-generator/docker-fragments/opt-add-woocommerce.yml) as well.

```bash
export BTCPAYGEN_ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENTS="$BTCPAYGEN_ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENTS;opt-add-woocommerce"
export WOOCOMMERCE_HOST="yourstoredomain.com"
```

4. Lastly, just run BTCPay Setup script which will add the set up variables.

```bash
. ./btcpay-setup.sh -i
```

5. Go to your store's domain name, in our example that's store.yourdomain.com and follow the WordPress installation wizard.
