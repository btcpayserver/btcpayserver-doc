## Prerequisites:

Before diving into the setup process, ensure you have the following:

- [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) account and store setup
- An active Shopify subscription plan (at least Basic Shopify plan)
- [A Shopify partner account](https://www.shopify.com/partners) (it's free to register)
- BTCPay Server - [self-hosted](Deployment.md) or run by a [third-party host](/Deployment/ThirdPartyHosting.md) * v2.0.6 or later.
- [Created BTCPay Server store](CreateStore.md) with [wallet set up](WalletSetup.md)

* Please note that if you are on a 3rd-party host, they need to have activated the shopify fragment and enabled the Shopify v2 plugin for you. Otherwise it won't be available in your BTCPay Server.

## Set up a Shopify app

First we will create a new app in the Shopify partner portal. Make sure you are registered as a [Shopify partner](https://www.shopify.com/partners) (it's free to register).

1. On Shopify Partner [dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com), click on `Apps` > `All Apps` > `Create App` > `Create app manually`. Enter the name you want to call the app (e.g. BTCPay Server) and click `Create`.
2. Once created displays your "Client ID" and "Client secret", which we need in a minute. Please note them down or come back to this page later.
   ![Shopify-App: client id and secret](./img/shopifyv2/partner-app_client-id-secret.png)
3. Click on the shopify partner logo on the to return to partners dashboard
4. At the bottom of the page, click on "Settings"   
   ![partners_settings.png](./img/shopifyv2/partners_settings.png)
5. Scroll down to the bottom section of "CLI Token" and click on "Manage tokens"
   ![partners_settings-cli-token.png](./img/shopifyv2/partners_settings-cli-token.png)
6. On top right click on "Generate new token"
   ![partners_create-cli-token.png](./img/shopifyv2/partners_create-cli-token.png)
7. In the modal popup keep the default and click on "Generate token"
   ![partners_create-cli-token-duration.png](./img/shopifyv2/partners_create-cli-token-duration.png)
8. Copy the token and note it next to client ID and client secret from above. This token is only shown once.
   ![partners_cli-token-created.png](./img/shopifyv2/partners_cli-token-created.png)


## Deploy the Shopify-BTCPay-app on your BTCPay Server

:::tip
For the instructions below to work you need to be the admin of your own BTCPay Server instance. If you are on a 3rd-party host then their admin needs to have activated the shopify fragment and enabled the Shopify v2 plugin for you, otherwise it won't be available to you.
:::

### Deploy the Shopify fragment

1. Log into your BTCPay Server via SSH
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
# if you are not root user, switch to root
sudo su -

# go to the BTCPay Server docker directory
cd $BTCPAY_BASE_DIRECTORY
cd btcpayserver-docker

# add the shopify fragment to your BTCPay Server
export BTCPAYGEN_ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENTS="$BTCPAYGEN_ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENTS;opt-add-shopify"

# run the setup script
. ./btcpay-setup.sh -i
```

The setup script fetches the [BTCPay Shopify app](https://github.com/btcpayserver/shopify-app) and deploys it to a docker container. If you want to be sure it worked you can check with:

```bash
docker ps | grep shopify
```

We can now proceed with installing the BTCPay Server Shopify plugin.

### Install BTCPay Server Shopify plugin v2

1. On your BTCPay Server, click on "Manage Plugins" in the sidebar, find and install the "BTCPay Server Shopify plugin v2" by btcpayserver.
![plugin_install.png](./img/shopifyv2/plugin_install.png)
2. After that, scroll to the top and click on the "Restart now" link to restart BTCPay.
![plugin_install-restart.png](./img/shopifyv2/plugin_install-restart.png)

### Configure BTCPay Server Shopify plugin
1. Make sure your store is selected at the top, then on the left sidebar click on `Shopify v2`
2. In the first of 3 sections you will need to enter the `Client ID`, `Client Secret` from [Shopify app setup](#set-up-a-shopify-app) above. Click on "Save"
   ![plugin_section-1.png](./img/shopifyv2/plugin_section-1.png)
3. In the next section "Deploy the app" you need to enter the `App name`, best to use the same as on [Shopify app setup](#setup-a-shopify-app). In the field `CLI token` enter the also previously noted "CLI Token" from the app setup.
   ![plugin_section-2.png](./img/shopifyv2/plugin_section-2.png)
4. Click on "Deploy App"
   You will now see some console output and that the app will be deployed to shopify. If everything goes well the section will close and the last section will open.
   ![plugin_section-2--console-output.png](./img/shopifyv2/plugin_section-2--console-output.png)
5. In the last section "Install the app on your Shopify store" there is nothing to do, it will just check if the app is installed on the store. We will do that in the next steps below.
   ![plugin_section-3.png](./img/shopifyv2/plugin_section-3.png)


## Install BTCPay-Shopify app on your Shopify store

Now it's time to install your Shopify app to the Shopify store (which will link your store to your BTCPay Server).

1. On your partner account app overview, select the app you just created, click on `Choose distribution` and select `Custom distribution`. Confirm the selection.
    :::tip
    Please note that selecting custom distribution means that you can only use the app one Shopify store. This is irreversible. You can deploy multiple apps though if you have more than one store.
    :::
    ![App install: select custom distribution](./img/shopifyv2/app-deploy_custom-distribution-1.png)
    ![App install: confirm custom distribution](./img/shopifyv2/app-deploy_distribution-confirm.png)

2. On the next screen enter the Shopify store URL that you want to link the application to. This is typically the internal store url you see on configuring the store, e.g. your-store.myshopify.com.
    Make sure to uncheck "Allow multi-store install for one Plus organization"
    ![App install: enter your store url](./img/shopifyv2/app-deploy_distribution-generate-link.png)
3. Click on `Generate link` and you will see a link generated.
   ![App install: link generated](./img/shopifyv2/app-deploy_distribution-generated-link-copy.png)
4. You will see your app listed and you can now install it by clicking on `Install`.
   ![app-deploy_distribution-install-to-store-confirm.png](./img/shopifyv2/app-deploy_distribution-install-to-store-confirm.png)
5. Once installed, you will see the app page with the message "Shopify plugin successfully configured"
   ![app-deploy_install-successful.png](./img/shopifyv2/app-deploy_install-successful.png)
6. You can click on the link to double-check that the app is properly connected to your BTCPay Server. (The last section has now also a green checkmark)
   ![app-deploy_plugin-all-green.png](./img/shopifyv2/app-deploy_plugin-all-green.png)

## Customize the "Thank you" page

1. On your shopify dashboard, click on `Settings`, which is located on the bottom of the left nav panel, select `Checkout` and then `Customize`.   
   ![Store steup: settings](./img/shopifyv2/app-setup_step-4-1.png)
   ![Store setup: settings customize checkout](./img/shopifyv2/app-setup_step-4-2.png)
2. In the editor change the selected page to the "Thank you" page.   
   ![Store setup: switch to thank you page](./img/shopifyv2/app-setup_step-5-1.png)   
   ![Store setup: thank you page](./img/shopifyv2/app-setup_step-5-2.png)
3. Click on the `Apps` icon on the left panel
   ![App Setup: Step 9](./img/shopifyv2/app-setup_step-6.png)
4. Click on the (+) sign on the listed "BTCPay Checkout" app and then on the "Thank you" page listed.
   ![App Setup: Step 10](./img/shopifyv2/app-setup_step-7.png)
5. You will now see the extension got added to your "Thank you" page. Click `save` in the top right corner.
   ![App Setup: Step 11](./img/shopifyv2/app-setup_step-8.png)
6. To double-check all is working, click on the left arrow `<` next to "BTCPay Checkout" and verify it is listed in the "Order details section".
   ![App Setup: Step 12.1](./img/shopifyv2/app-setup_step-9-1.png)
   ![App Setup: Step 12.2](./img/shopifyv2/app-setup_step-9-2.png)

## Set up a custom payment method in Shopify

One last step is to set up a custom payment method in Shopify to display the Bitcoin payment option to your customers.

1. Go back to your dashboard, click on `Settings` >> `Payments` in the left sidebar, scroll down to "Manual payment methods", click on `(+) Manual payment method` and select `Create custom payment method` on the dropdown.
   ![Create payment method step 1](./img/shopifyv2/pm_step_1.png)
2. In `Custom payment method name` fill in something like `Pay with Bitcoin (BTCPay Server)` (also see TIP box below), optionally you can fill in other fields, but it's not required.
   However, you would need to inform your customers that payment with Bitcoin comes on the next screen after checkout on the "Thank you" page. Ideally you would inform your customers in the `Additional details` field.
   The payment option can have a slight delay before it shows on the "Thank you" page, we suggest to communicate that to the customers. Suggested text: `Please note that the Bitcoin payment button "Complete payment" will be displayed on the "Thank you"-page. Please click on it to complete the payment.`
3. Hit `Activate` and you've set up Shopify and BTCPay Server payment method successfully.
   ![Create payment method step 2 and 3](./img/shopifyv2/pm_step_2_and_3.png)

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the BTCPay-Shopify app and set up the payment method on your Shopify store. You are ready to go. See the demo checkout flow below.


## Demo Checkout flow after everything is set up

Customer select the payment option on the checkout page:
![Shopify checkout show payment option](./img/shopifyv2/payment_option.png)

Customer gets redirected to the "Thank you"-page where the payment button is shown:
![Shopify Thank you page with pay button](./img/shopifyv2/complete_payment.png)

Customer clicks on "Complete payment" and gets redirected to BTCPay payment page:
![Customer click on complete payment](./img/shopifyv2/btcpay_checkout.png)

Customer pays the invoice and clicks on return to merchant:
![Customer paid invoice](./img/shopifyv2/invoice_paid.png)

Customer gets redirected to Shopify order status page:
![Order status page after payment](./img/shopifyv2/order_status_page_after_payment.png)

---

In your BTCPay Server store you can see the paid invoice:
![BTCPay Server shopify step 37](./img/shopifyv2/paid_invoice_btcpay.png)

When you click on it you can see the payment details:

## Troubleshooting

### How to update BTCPay Shopify app?

When you see or hear that the [BTCPay Shopify app](https://github.com/btcpayserver/shopify-app) has been updated, you can push the new version to your store by following these steps:

cd $BTCPAY_BASE_DIRECTORY
cd btcpayserver-docker

./btcpay-update.sh
```

3. On the left sidebar click on `Shopify v2`
4. Expand the second section "Deploy the app"
5. Paste the CLI token and click on "Deploy App"
