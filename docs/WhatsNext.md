After you've connected your wallet to your BTCPay, you can explore various built in tools in the software. See the full list of Use Cases [here](./UseCase.md).

## Creating the Point of Sale App

BTCPay has a PoS app which you can use to receive payments from your customers directly or to receive donations. To **create the POS app**, you need to have a store created in BTCPay. View PoS instructions [here](./Apps.md#point-of-sale-app).

## Creating the Crowdfund App

Create a **crowdfunding campaign using BTCPay**. Unlike traditional crowdfunding platforms, the creator of the campaign is the owner of the platform. Funds go directly to the creatorâ€™s wallet without any fees. View Crowdfund instructions [here](./Apps.md#crowdfunding-app).

## Creating the Payment Request

Create **custom invoices which can be shared with others**, by sending a link to your payment request. Users can pay the request at any time. BTCPay automatically updates the BTC exchange rate at the time of payment. View Payment Request instructions [here](./PaymentRequests.md).

## Creating the Pay Button

**Pay buttons** are great when you have a fixed amount for a product or a donation. You can easily embed the button into HTML. When the customer or a visitor clicks on the button, BTCPay displays a checkout page and an invoice for them. View Pay Button instructions [here](./Apps.md#payment-button).

## Connecting your BTCPay store to your e-commerce platform

Depending on the CMS you're using, you can easily connect BTCPay to your online store. Currently, BTCPay offers following integrations :

* [WooCommerce](./WooCommerce.md)
* [Shopify](./Shopify.md)

**BTC Transmuter is a self-hosted service that allows you to automate your money and other tasks using BTCPay**. Create custom, automated processes using crypto service triggers based on BTCPay. Common use-cases are fiat integration, payment forwarding and email automation. Open lightning channels, detect payments and more, using blockchain data from your own nodes in BTCPay.
