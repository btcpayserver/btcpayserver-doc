# BTCPayServer Documentation

## Introduction

BTCPayServer is an open-source, self-hosted payment processor for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

If you have any issues with BTCPay, please file a [Github issue](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/issues).
If you have more general questions, please come on [Slack](http://slack.btcpayserver.org/) or check our [Wiki Page](https://nbitstack.com/c/btcpayserver) for common issues.

This solution is for you if:

* You want to be in control of your own funds
* Compliance teams of traditional payment processors rejected your application
* You want lower fees (we support SegWit)
* You want a way to support payments in altcoins
* You want to accept payments on the Lightning Network
* You want universally compatible invoices (we support the Bitpay API)
