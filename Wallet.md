# BTCPay Server Wallet

This document explains the features of the internal BTCPay wallet. For frequently asked questions - check the [Wallets FAQ](FAQ/FAQ-Wallet.md)

*Note: A [private key](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key) (xprv) is **never** required for receiving money on-chain to a BTCPay wallet. The software needs a public key (xpubkey) which is a watch-only wallet token. The xpubkey allows BTCPay to generate a new address each time a new invoice is generated. It enables users to observe the wallet balance and transactions without having to share their private key. An exception is [Lightning Network](LightningNetwork.md) which is a hot wallet with keys online.*

The on-chain wallet does not generate a private key. Users have to create their own private key externally and import an xpubkey derived from the private key into Store Settings > Derivation scheme.  The public key (xpubkey) can be imported from a compatible hardware wallet or added manually by pasting the key into the field and adding an appropriate suffix. For more information on how to add a derivation scheme to BTCPay, see the [Recommended Wallets](ConnectWallet.md). If you're using a [third-party host](ThirdPartyHosting.md) and are asked to provide a private key, it's certainly a scam. Never share your private key with anyone. It's called private for a reason.

BTCPay's **internal**, full-node reliant wallet that can be accessed by clicking **Wallets** from the top menu. The reliance on the user's own full node makes the wallet more private and secure compared to any [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Simplified_Payment_Verification_.28SPV.29) wallet.

Each store and a cryptocurrency have a separate wallet displayed on the Wallets page. To access a particular wallet, click **Manage**.

### Send

The Send function allows spending of the funds from the BTCPay wallet.

![Send from the Wallet](/img/BTCPayWallets3.png)

To spend the funds, the user is required to **sign** the transaction. Transactions can be signed with:

- Ledger Hardware Wallet
- HD Private key or mnemonic seed
- Wallet supporting PSBT
- Hardware Wallet (BTCPay Vault)
- Hot Wallet

#### Signing with Ledger Hardware wallet

Ledger Nano S has a native integration and can be used to spend bitcoin and [altcoins](Altcoins.md) from the wallet. Both Nano S and Ledger X can be used with [BTCPay Vault](Vault.md) for smoother experience for bitcoin transactions.

Check this [tutorial on how to sign a transaction with Ledger Nano S](LedgerWallet.md#spending-from-btcpay-server-wallet-with-ledger)

#### Signing with HD Private Key or mnemonic seed

Transactions in BTCPay's wallet can be signed with a private key or mnemonic seed. Prior to inputing the private key, make sure to set a proper `AccountKeyPath` in Wallet > Settings.

#### Signing with a wallet supporting PSBT

PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin transaction) is supported and can be signed with a PSBT compatible wallet.

Check this tutorial on how to [sign a transaction with ColdCard Hardware Wallet](ColdCardWallet.md#spending-from-btcpay-server-wallet-with-coldcard-psbt) completely air-gaped.

#### Signing with Hardware Wallets (BTCPay Vault)

[BTCPay Vault](https://blog.btcpayserver.org/btcpay-vault/) is a cross-platform desktop application that makes it possible to use a wide range of hardware wallets with the BTCPay Wallet.

Check [BTCPay Vault](Vault.md) documentation for instructions on how to set up and sign with a [compatible hardware wallet](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI#device-support).

#### Signing with a Hot Wallet

BTCPay Server also allows stores to generate or import a wallet while also storing its private keys. If your store was configured this way, you'll have the option available in the "Sign with.." dropdown.

[Using the hot wallet feature comes with its own security implications, please be sure to read and understand them over at the Hot Wallet documentation.](HotWallet.md)

### Receive

The receive tab generates an unused address which can be used to receive payments. The same can be achieved by generating an invoice (Invoices > Create new invoice).

### Advanced Settings

#### Make sure no change UTXO is created (Advanced mode)

This option is available in the `Advanced mode` of the Send page.

It is a privacy enhancing feature which is useful when you send to another of your own wallets or to an exchange. It makes sure that no change UTXO is created by **rounding up** the amount sent.

By default this feature is disabled, so if your wallet has a UTXO of `1.1 BTC` and you input an amount equals to `1.0 BTC`, the resulting transaction will have two outputs `0.1 BTC` of change, and `1.0 BTC` to your destination.

Blockchain analysis will understand that those `0.1 BTC` of change belong to the same entity which controlled `1.1 BTC` before, and can track the future purchase you make under the same pattern.

By enabling this feature, BTCPay Server wallet will round up the amount sent to `1.1 BTC` such that no change output is sent back to you.

Warning: Despite the fact, in this example, that you entered `1.0` in the amount field, the amount that will really be sent to your destination will be `1.1 BTC`.

### Re-scan

The Rescan relies on Bitcoin Core 0.17.0's scantxoutset to scan the current state of the blockchain (called UTXO Set) for coins belonging to the derivation scheme being used. 

![Wallet rescan](/img/BTCPayWallets4.png)

Wallet re-scan solves two critical problems for BTCPay users:

1. [Gap limit](FAQ/FAQ-Wallet.md#missing-payments-in-my-software-or-hardware-wallet)
2. Importing a previously used wallet

**Gap limit**: Most of the wallets have the gap limit set to 20. This means that if a merchant receives 21 or more consecutive unpaid invoices, those wallets show the incorrect balance and some transactions may not be visible.

**Wallet import**: When users add a derivation scheme of a wallet that had transactions in the past (previously used wallet), BTCPay won't be able to show the balance and transactions from the past.

![Wallet rescan progress](/img/BTCPayWallets5.png)

Re-scan is a feature that solves both of these problems. Once the scan is complete, BTCPay Server will show the correct balance, along with the past transactions of the wallet. 

Wallet re-scan requires access to the full node which means that this function is only available for server owners.

Users who use a third party host should use a newly generated xpub key and also use an external wallet like Electrum which allows them to increase the gap limit.
